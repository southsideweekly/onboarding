## Joining the SSW Data Team
Hello! We'd love to work with you. **[If you haven't done so already, please fill out the new contributor form.](https://southsideweekly.com/contribute/)** 

Data Editor: Jasmine Mithani, `jasmine.mithani@southsideweekly.com`

## Positions
There are many roles you can take at the Weekly! Here are the most common ones that are needed for data projects.

**Visualization**: Creating infographics and charts for stories, anywhere from one to three weeks turnaround. Excel, Adobe Illustrator, R (ggplot2), and Python (pandas, seaborn) are all standard choices, but we welcome experience with other tools such as Tableau, drawings, or other creative interpretations! This job works with the primary editor, the visuals editor, and the data editor to put together an accurate, attractive visualization. Understanding of principles behind good design, and presenting numbers fairly, is keyâ€”if you haven't done visualization before, we're happy to help you learn!

**Data reporting/analysis**: Work alongside reporters to find the story in spreadsheets. Usually work as part of a team, but can write a piece themselves if they want too. This job involves cleaning data, matching records across data sets, and then digging into analysis. The Weekly team right now works in Python (pandas) through Jupyter Notebook for ease of documentation and sharing; we're open to contributions from other languages. Most of the analysis we do involves census data or the results of FOIA requests. A basic grasp of statistics is useful, but numeracy is most important. Data reporting projects are usually three weeks to three months, depending on the type of reporting being done. Right now most resources go into investigative projects, but it would be wonderful to have shorter-turnaround data pieces more frequently in the paper.

**Mapping**: One of the most used visualizations at the Weekly are maps! We make them at all scales, from showing the configurations of buildings to comparisons of resources across Chicago. The turnaround for a map is usually a few days to two weeks. Tools vary depending on the task and can include Carto, Mapbox, QGIS, ArcGIS, and Google Maps.
